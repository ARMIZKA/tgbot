# Timetable telegram bot

Objective: create a telegram bot for the schedule using the "telebot" library and link a database to it.

Progress:
1. Create a bot in Telegram using "BotFather"
2. Import the libraries into main.py to create the bot.
3. We take the token from the bot and insert it into our code.
4. We create the bot object in the code.
5. Create decorators that respond to commands (“Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Thursday”, “Friday”, “Schedule for the current week”, “Schedule for the next week”).
6. Create a database and connect to it.
7. Create a schema and add the "subjects" and "teachers" tables and make a "timetable" out of them.
8. We write the code to display data from the table and get the finished bot.
